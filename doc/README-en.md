**WizNotePlus** is a cross-platform cloud based note-taking client.

## Introduction

The **WizNotePlus** project is dedicated to improving the usability of cross-platform client **[WizQTClient](https://github.com/WizTeam/WizQTClient)** to meet or exceed that of the Windows platform-specific client. In order to reach the goal, we need to implement a developer-friendly plugin system and promote the establishment of a third-party developer community with good atmosphere. This project is initiated and maintained by third-party developers in compliance with the GPLv3 agreement. Any developer or user who wishes to participate in the project is welcome to contact `altair_wei@outlook.com` .
